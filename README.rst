Avocado VT Plugin
=================

Avocado Virt Test Compatibility is a plugin that lets you
execute virtualization related tests, with all conveniences
provided by avocado.

Getting started with avocado-vt
===============================

Here's a reference guide on how to get the plugin setup and running,
assuming you are using git repos for avocado and avocado-vt.

1. Make sure you have avocado and avocado-vt repositories cloned in the same dir.
   then you can execute our `make link` target::

    $ make link

2. Run the bootstrap procedure for the test backend (qemu, libvirt, v2v,
   openvswitch, among others) of your interest. We'll use qemu as an example::

    $ scripts/avocado vt-bootstrap --vt-type qemu

   That command will generate the following symlinks in your avocado source code
   dir (assuming you have only avocado-vt, and not avocado-virt)::

    avocado/core/plugins/virt_test.py
    avocado/core/plugins/virt_test_list.py
    etc/avocado/conf.d/virt-test.conf
    virttest

5. Let's test if things went well by listing the avocado plugins. In the avocado source dir, do::

    $ scripts/avocado plugins

   That command should show the loaded plugins, and hopefully no errors. The relevant lines will be::

    virt_test_compat_bootstrap  Implements the avocado 'vt-bootstrap' subcommand
    virt_test_compat_runner  Implements the avocado virt test options
    virt_test_compat_lister  Implements the avocado virt test options

6. The next test is to see if virt-tests are also listed in the output of the
   command `avocado list`::

    $ scripts/avocado list --verbose

   This should list a large amount of tests (over 1900 virt related tests)::

    ACCESS_DENIED: 0
    BROKEN_SYMLINK: 0
    BUGGY: 0
    INSTRUMENTED: 52
    MISSING: 0
    NOT_A_TEST: 27
    SIMPLE: 3
    VT: 1923

7. Assuming all is well, you can try running one virt-test::

    $ scripts/avocado run type_specific.io-github-autotest-qemu.migrate.default.tcp
    JOB ID     : <id>
    JOB LOG    : /home/<user>/avocado/job-results/job-2015-06-15T19.46-1c3da89/job.log
    JOB HTML   : /home/<user>/avocado/job-results/job-2015-06-15T19.46-1c3da89/html/results.html
    TESTS      : 1
    (1/1) type_specific.io-github-autotest-qemu.migrate.default.tcp: PASS (95.76 s)
    PASS       : 1
    ERROR      : 0
    FAIL       : 0
    SKIP       : 0
    WARN       : 0
    INTERRUPT  : 0
    TIME       : 95.76 s

If you have trouble executing the steps provided in this guide, you have a few
options:

* Send an e-mail to `the avocado mailing list <https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/avocado-devel>`__.
* Open an issue on `the avocado-vt github area <https://github.com/avocado-framework/avocado-vt/issues/new>`__.
* We also hang out on `IRC (irc.oftc.net, #avocado) <irc://irc.oftc.net/#avocado>`__.
