"""Cluster logging server for distributed virtualization testing.

This module provides a centralized logging server that collects and processes
log messages from remote nodes in a cluster environment. It implements a
socket-server-based architecture for handling multiple concurrent logging
connections from distributed test nodes.

The module consists of:
- LoggerServer: Main server class for managing the logging infrastructure
- _LoggerStreamHandler: Handler for processing incoming log streams
- _Server: Custom TCP server with timeout and abort capabilities
- LoggerServerError: Exception class for logger-specific errors
