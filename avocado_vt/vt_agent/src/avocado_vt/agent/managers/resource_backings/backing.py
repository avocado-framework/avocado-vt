class ResourceBacking(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for resource backings in the VT resource management system.

    Resource backings are node-local implementations of resources that provide the actual
    interface to physical assets on worker nodes. Each backing represents one resource
    on one worker node, enabling distributed access to resources while maintaining local
    performance and isolation.

    Backings serve as the execution layer for resource operations, translating abstract
    resource commands from the master node into concrete local operations (volume creation,
    etc.) through their associated pool connections.

    Key Design Principles:
        Stateless Design: Backings maintain no changeable state to ensure consistency
                         across distributed deployments where resources may have multiple
                         backings on different nodes

        Command Pattern: Operations are handled through registered command handlers
                        (allocate, release, sync) for extensible lifecycle management

        Pool Integration: Backings work through pool connections to access underlying
                         resources on the worker node

    Backing Lifecycle:
        1. Creation: Backing object instantiated with resource configuration
        2. Operations: Commands executed through pool connection
        3. Destruction: Backing removed when resource is unbound from node

        Never add a changeable attribute, e.g. allocated, because a resource
        can have more than one backing, when it changes from one backing, we
        have to update all other backings' allocated attribute. So allocated
        can only be an item of spec or an attribute for the resource object.
