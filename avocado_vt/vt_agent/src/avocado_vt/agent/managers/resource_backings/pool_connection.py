class ResourcePoolConnection(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for managing resource pool connections from worker nodes.

    This class defines the interface for establishing and maintaining connections
    between worker nodes and resource pools. Each pool type requires a specific
    connection mechanism - for example, NFS pools require mounting the NFS share.

    The connection lifecycle is managed by the ResourceBackingManager and follows
    the pattern: initialize → open → maintain → close. Implementations must be
    idempotent and handle connection state transitions gracefully.

    Attributes:
        POOL_TYPE (str): Unique identifier for the pool type this connection handles
        _pool_id (str): UUID of the pool this connection manages

    Abstract Methods:
        open(): Establish the physical connection to the pool
        close(): Terminate the connection and cleanup resources
        connected: Property indicating current connection status
    """
