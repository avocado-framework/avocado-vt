class ResourceBackingManager(object):
    """
    Manages resource backings and pool connections on worker nodes.

    The ResourceBackingManager serves as the central coordinator for all resource-related
    operations on worker nodes in the VT cluster. It maintains the lifecycle of resource
    backing objects (node-local implementations of resources) and pool connection objects
    (connections to local or shared resource pools).

    This manager operates on worker nodes and communicates with the central ResourceManager
    on the master node through the cluster proxy system. It handles the worker-side aspects
    of the distributed resource management architecture.

    Key Responsibilities:
        - Pool connection management: establishing and maintaining connections to resource pools
        - Resource backing lifecycle: creating, managing, and destroying resource backings
        - State persistence: maintaining manager state across process boundaries
        - Service coordination: providing resource services to the cluster proxy

    Architecture Integration:
        Master Node: ResourceManager coordinates cluster-wide resource state
        Worker Nodes: ResourceBackingManager handles node-local resource operations
        Communication: Cluster proxy enables master-worker coordination

    State Persistence:
        The manager persists its state to BACKING_MGR_ENV_FILENAME to handle scenarios
        where the agent daemon is not running (e.g., when worker node is also master node).
        State restoration occurs during initialization to maintain consistency.
