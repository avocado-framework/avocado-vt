"""
This module provides an Avocado-VT plugin for managing a test cluster.

The `VTCluster` plugin hooks into the job lifecycle to perform setup before
tests run and cleanup after they complete. It is responsible for starting and
stopping agent servers on cluster nodes, handling metadata, and collecting
logs. This ensures that the test environment is properly configured and torn
down for cluster-based tests.
