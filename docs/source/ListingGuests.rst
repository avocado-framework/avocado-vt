Listing guests
==============

If you want to see all guests defined, you can use

::

    $ avocado list -vt-type [test type] --list-guests


This will generate a list of possible guests that can be used for tests,
provided that you have an image with them. The list will show which guests
don't have an image currently available. If you did perform the usual
bootstrap procedure, only JeOS.17.64 will be available.

Now, let's assume you have the image for another guest. Let's say you've
installed Fedora 17, 64 bits, and that --list-guests shows it as downloaded

::

    $ avocado list --vt-type qemu --vt-list-guests
    ...
    Linux.CentOS.6.6.i386.i440fx (missing centos66-32.qcow2)
    Linux.CentOS.6.6.x86_64.i440fx (missing centos66-64.qcow2)

You can list all the available tests for Fedora.17.64 (you must use the exact
string printed by the test, minus obviously the index number, that's there
only for informational purposes:

::

    $ avocado list --vt-type qemu --vt-guest-os Linux.CentOS.6.6.i386.i440fx --verbose
    ...
    VT           io-github-autotest-qemu.trans_hugepage.base
    VT           io-github-autotest-qemu.trans_hugepage.defrag
    VT           io-github-autotest-qemu.trans_hugepage.swapping
    VT           io-github-autotest-qemu.trans_hugepage.relocated
    VT           io-github-autotest-qemu.trans_hugepage.migration
    VT           io-github-autotest-qemu.trans_hugepage.memory_stress
    VT           io-github-autotest-qemu.ntpd
    VT           io-github-autotest-qemu.clock_getres
    VT           io-github-autotest-qemu.autotest_regression
    VT           io-github-autotest-qemu.shutdown

    ACCESS_DENIED: 0
    BROKEN_SYMLINK: 0
    BUGGY: 0
    FILTERED: 0
    INSTRUMENTED: 52
    MISSING: 0
    NOT_A_TEST: 27
    SIMPLE: 3
    VT: 2375

Then you can execute one in particular. It's the same idea, just copy the
individual test you want and run it:

::

    $ avocado run balloon_check --vt-type qemu --vt-guest-os Fedora.21

And it'll run that particular test.
