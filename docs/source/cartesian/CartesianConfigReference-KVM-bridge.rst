bridge
======

Description
-----------

Sets the name of the bridge to which a VM nic will be added to. This
only applies to scenarios where 'nic\_mode' is set to 'tap'.

It can be set as a default to all nics:

::

    bridge = virbr0

Or to a specific nic, by prefixing the parameter key with the nic name,
that is for attaching 'nic1' to bridge 'virbr1':

::

    bridge_nic1 = virbr1
