Avocado-vt maintainers
======================

The intention of this file is not to establish who owns what portions of the
code base, but to provide a set of names that developers can consult when they
have a question about a particular subset and also to provide a set of names
you can look for on github for any pull requests you might want to get approved.

In general, if you have a question, you should send an email to the Virt Test
development mailing list and not any specific individual privately.
